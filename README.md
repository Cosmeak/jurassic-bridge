# JurassicBridge

JurassicBridge is a wrapper library in node.js for the Pterodactyl API V1. 

For now, you can use the client part of the API. This was principaly design to create a Discord bot and handle interaction between the Pterodactyl Panel and the bot.
However it can be used in every node.js project.

## Getting Started


```bash
$ npm i jurassic-bridge
```
